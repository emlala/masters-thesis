# Material from my Master's Thesis

My Master's Thesis was a political discourse analysis, which concentrated on evasive responses in parliamentary setting. The thesis was graded as Magna Cum Laude Approbatur, or 4/5.

I was asked to present my thesis as a poster in an event of the English department, I have added the thesis as a PDF to this repo.
